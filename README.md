# Advent of Code

[![Elixir CI](https://github.com/tonnenpinguin/advent_of_code/actions/workflows/elixir.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tonnenpinguin/advent_of_code/actions/workflows/elixir.yml)

My attempt at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Installation

Run `mix deps.get` to get started and make sure to put your AoC session token into `session_token.txt`. 
Run `mix aoc` to fetch the current days example and input files.
Run `mix test` to run the doctests!

In the iex shell run `p1e` or `p2e` to run the current days solutions with example data and `p1i` or `p2i` to run with input data.

See [https://hexdocs.pm/advent_of_code_utils/readme.html](https://hexdocs.pm/advent_of_code_utils/readme.html) for more info.
